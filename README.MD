## Sample z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition Service Provider

A z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE) Service Provider which demonstrates how to build a
service provider and include it as part of a z/OS Connect EE configuration.

### Pre-reqs

* [WebSphere Liberty](http://wasdev.net) installed locally
* The z/OS Connect EE SPI JAR file downloaded from a z/OS Connect EE install.
* [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) installed on development platform

### Installing

* Clone this repository `git clone git://github.com/zosconnect/zosconnect-sample-provider.git`
* Update `build.xml` to point to the location of your Liberty install and the SPI jar.
* Build the feature `ant build_feature`
* Transfer the esa file to the mainframe. If using `ftp` ensure the file is transferred as binary.
* Install the feature into your z/OS Connect EE environment `wlp/bin/installUtility install com.ibm.zosconnect.sample.provider.feature-1.0.0.0.esa --to=usr`
   * If using the default location for z/OS Connect EE servers then set the environment variable `WLP_USER_DIR=/var/zosconnect`

### Configuring

* Add the following to the `featureManager` section
```
<feature>usr:sampleProvider</feature>
```
* Create a service definition
```
<zosconnect_zosConnectService id="sampleService" serviceName="sampleService"
                           serviceRef="dateService" serviceDescription="">
</zosconnect_zosConnectService>
<usr_sampleService id="dateService" timezone="GMT"/>
```

Alternatively a SAR file built using the [sample Build Toolkit plugin](https://github.com/zosconnect/zosconnect-sample-buildtoolkit-plugin) can be placed in the services directory
to install the service.

### Testing

* Start the server
* Verify the service has been installed by doing an HTTP GET to `https://host:port/zosConnect/services`
* Invoke the service by sending an HTTP PUT to `https://host:port/zosConnect/services/sampleService?action=invoke` with a payload of
```
{
    'input': 'test'
}
```

### Updating

If you want to use this sample as the basis of your own service provider, or add extra functionality to
this service provider then the contents of the `src` directory can be imported into an Eclipse installation
which has the WDT tools installed.
